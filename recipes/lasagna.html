            <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef and onion over medium heat until the meat is no longer pink. Drain off any excess fat.</li>
            <li>Add the canned tomatoes, fresh herbs, sugar, spices, and seasonings to the skillet. Simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine the cheese and eggs. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer with noodles, cheese mixture, and meat sauce. Repeat the layers until all the ingredients are used up.</li>
            <li>Cover the dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the lasagna is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
